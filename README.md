# Blood-cells-image-classification
In this repository you will find the Homework for the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course. The Homework consisted in using the Keras API and TensorFlow platform to design an artificial neural network and train it with the goal of correctly classify Blood Cells images. The final test was done on an unknown dataset, filled with augmented and distorted images, so the focus was on generalizing the knowledge of the model so that it would not overfit. The final model reached an accuracy of 98% on an unknown non- augmented dataset and 89% on an augmented one.

The project received maximum grade.
